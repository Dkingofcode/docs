# â„¹ Workflow for Interns

***

{% hint style="info" %}
Interns have permission to assign themselves to issue tickets in our GitHub organization
{% endhint %}

## How to find Tasks or issues to work on

* Check the _**Todo**_ column of the [Collabo Sprints and Task Progress Board](https://github.com/orgs/code-collabo/projects/1), pick an unassigned issue ticket, and assign yourself to the issue ticket.&#x20;
* If you cannot find an unassigned one on the progress board, or there is none in there that interests you, then check the [Collabo Community Task Board](https://github.com/orgs/code-collabo/projects/2/views/1). You can choose from any column on this board depending on your interest. Assign yourself to the issue ticket.

## How and where to report issues

Go to the issues tab of the [.github repo](https://github.com/code-collabo/.github) to report the issue(s) you find for any Code Collabo project. The repo maintainers will then review and send it to the appropriate repo and project board where contributors will be able to find it, get assigned to it, and help fix it.
