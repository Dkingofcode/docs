_In this guide, you will find ongoing projects you can contribute to. Our current projects involve building libraries (to be used in web applications), UI/UX and graphic design, technical writing, and documentation - the kind of projects we take on may change or expand with time (and funding)._

{% hint style="info" %}
Before you check out the projects listed below and before you start contributing, please read the following: the _**community code of conduct**_, the _**contributing guide**_, and the _**workflow**_ we adopt when developing our projects. You can find these in the sidebar.

## Node Mongo

Node Mongo is comprised of a number of projects: A set of backend application boilerplate templates to be used for local development when building web apps, a package that helps make this set of templates available to the user, and a package containing scripts. The scripts package helps store the following: helper functions/functionalities common to the projects involved, and the code for the boilerplate template's automated walkthrough prompts when running the development server. _**Go to Node Mongo project docs.**_

## Collabo Web App

The Collabo Web App is a standalone project. We are building this to help create more awareness and visibility for the Code Collabo Community, the projects, and the programs within it. It is also a means to test out and showcase the use of our internally built projects that are useful for web app development, such as node-mongo and Collabo CSS framework. This project is still at the initial stage. _**Go to Collabo Web App docs.**_

## Collabo CSS

The Collabo CSS framework project is a standalone project to be used in web app projects. When it is published, it will not only be usable for styling the web projects we build in the Code Collabo community. It is built in a way that other communities or persons can use it also. This project is still at the initial stage. _**Go to Collabo CSS project docs.**_

## Collabo Docs

Documentation involves writing any of the following: Instructions to help new and old community members (contributors or users) navigate through and get the best out of the community. User instructions for where to find and how to use published code collabo projects/products. Instructions to help contributors with information on how to contribute, where to find projects to contribute to within the community, the workflows, and set up guides for the projects they choose/wish to contribute to. _**Go to Collabo community, user, and project docs.**_

***

## Collabo Blog

Collabo Blog is a standalone project that complements our community, user, and project documentation. Contributing to our blog entails writing educative content/topics around open source and that drives engagement within our community, and in open source communities generally. _**Go to Collabo Blog project docs.**_

## Git and GitHub for collaboration

Git and GitHub for collaboration is a standalone project. It entails developing a free video-based course content and curriculum for learning Git and Github, with a focus on how to use these tools for collaboration and when taking on tasks that involve working with others. Though there have been contributions submitted previously to move this project forward, this project can be said to be in its initial stage for now. _**Go to Git and GitHub for collaboration project docs.**_
