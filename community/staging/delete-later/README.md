## How and where to start?

Start by reading these resources to learn more about the Code Collabo program and FOSS community, and open source in general.

* [Code Collabo FOSS Community](https://code-collabo.hashnode.dev/what-is-code-collabo-and-who-is-it-for)
* [What does "Free and Open Source" mean?](https://code-collabo.hashnode.dev/what-does-free-and-open-source-mean)
* Learn to use Git and GitHub for collaboration

{% hint style="info" %}
Our Git and GitHub for Collaboration course link is currently no longer available as there is a need to update its content. We encourage you to visit YouTube tutorials or take courses on Git and GitHub pending the time it will be released again. You can also contribute to the development of the course.
