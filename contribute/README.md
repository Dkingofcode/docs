# ðŸ‘· Contribute to Collabo projects

***

_In this guide, you will find ongoing projects you can contribute to. Our current projects involve building libraries (to be used in web applications), UI/UX and graphic design, technical writing, and documentation - the kind of projects we take on may change or expand with time (and funding)._

***

{% hint style="info" %}
Before you check out the projects listed below and before you start contributing, please read the following: the community _**code of conduct**_, the _**contributing guide**_, and the _**workflow**_ we adopt when developing our projects. You can find these in the sidebar.
{% endhint %}

## Node Mongo

Node Mongo is comprised of a number of projects: A set of backend application boilerplate templates to be used for local development when building web apps, a package that helps make this set of templates available to the user, and a package containing scripts. The scripts package helps store the following: helper functions/functionalities common to the projects involved, and the code for the boilerplate template's automated walkthrough prompts when running the development server.

## Collabo Web App

The Collabo Web App is an internal project we are building to help create more awareness and visibility for the Code Collabo Community, the projects, and the programs within it. It is also a means to test out and showcase the use of our internally built projects that are useful for web app development, such as node-mongo and Collabo CSS framework. There are also UI/UX and graphics design-related opportunities for interested contributors here. This project is still at the initial stage.

## Collabo CSS

The Collabo CSS framework will help its users style web app projects easily compared to existing libraries or frameworks. When it is published, it will not only be usable for styling the web projects we build in the Code Collabo community. It is built in a way that other communities or persons can use it also. This project is still at the initial stage. [_**Go to Collabo CSS Contributor docs.**_](https://code-collabo.gitbook.io/collabo-contributor/collabo-css-project/contribute-to-collabo-css)

***

## Collabo Docs

Documentation involves writing any of the following: Instructions to help new and old community members (contributors or users) navigate through and get the best out of the community. User instructions for where to find and how to use published code collabo projects/products. Instructions to help contributors with information on how to contribute, where to find projects to contribute to within the community, the workflows, and set up guides for the projects they choose/wish to contribute to. [_**Go to Contributor docs for the Collabo documentation.**_](https://code-collabo.gitbook.io/collabo-contributor/collabo-documentation-projects/contribute-to-collabo-documentation-projects)

## Collabo Blog

The Collabo Blog project complements our community, user, and contributor documentation. Contributing to our blog entails writing educative content/topics around open source and that drives engagement within our community, and in open source communities generally.

## Git and GitHub for collaboration

The Git and GitHub for collaboration project complements our contributor documentation. At the same time, it can be useful to provide knowledge useful for open-source contributions outside the Code Collabo community. It entails developing a free video-based course content and curriculum for learning Git and Github, with a focus on how to use these tools for collaboration and when taking on tasks that involve working with others. Though there have been contributions submitted previously to move this project forward, this project can be said to be in its initial stage for now.
