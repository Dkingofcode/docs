_**Repository:**_ [https://github.com/code-collabo/node-mongo-cli](https://github.com/code-collabo/node-mongo-cli)

***

The node-mongo commands and flags for the node-mongo CLI are the same as what is in the user doc.

***

However, the method of installation is different during code development. Change directory into the root of the CLI repository, after cloning the repository locally to your computer (don't forget to create a new branch from develop before adding and pushing your changes)  - see the _**Contribution Workflow**_ page for detailed workflow info. Install globally and uninstall globally in this manner during code development:

1. Install dependencies

```
npm install
```

2. Link after installing dependencies:

```
npm link
```

3. Unlink (for when you are done developing):

```
npm unlink
```

{% tab title="API Boilerplate Template" %}
_**Repository:**_ [https://github.com/code-collabo/node-mongo-api-boilerplate-templates](https://github.com/code-collabo/node-mongo-api-boilerplate-templates)

***

Clone the repository locally on your computer (don't forget to create a new branch from develop before adding and pushing your changes) - see the _**Contribution Workflow**_ page for detailed workflow info. Change directory into the root of the API boilerplate template repository, and run the same npm scripts mentioned in the user doc i.e. npm install, npm run dev:atlas, npm run dev:local, etc.

***

How to handle the `.env` files are different during code development:

* Retain the `.env.example` file so that it doesn't get deleted from our repo when you submit your code fix
* Create a copy of the `.env.example` file, rename this copy to `.env` , then change the `PORT` and add other environment variables to store your secrets as desired in your `.env` file.
