See _**contribution workflow**_ in the sidebar for when you will need to get assigned to an issue or when you can assign yourself to an issue

* Submitting a pull request for an issue you are not assigned to will only be counted as spam.
* Try to submit a pull request for an issue within 2 days of showing interest, even if you are not through fixing the issue.
* Pull request title must reflect the Issue title you are working on, and it should start with "Fix: ". For example, If the issue title is "Add contribution rules section", the pull request title should be "Fix: Add contribution rules section".
* A pull request should be linked to the issue it aims to fix.
* Feel free to ask questions if you are not clear about something in the issue you are working on.
