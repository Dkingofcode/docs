## Guidelines for project repositories and issue tickets

* Read up and follow the instructions on the _**contribution workflow**_ page. It contains information on where to find tasks, how to interact with project repositories within the community, get assigned to an issue or assign yourself to an issue ticket you are interested in working on, and how to submit issues you find in any of the project repositories. We follow this Workflow strictly.
* Visit the specific contributing doc for the project you wish to contribute. You will also find them through the sidebar. For example, you would visit the _**Contribute to Node Mongo Projects**_ page if you wish to contribute to _**Node Mongo**_ project, etc.
* Visit our _**old Git and Github course playlist**_. You may no longer be able to access the repositories and assignments in the course for now, but the content is still very relevant and may save you from prolonged pull request reviews.

## Guidelines for submitting pull requests to any repository

* Submitting a pull request for an issue you are not assigned to will only be counted as spam.
* Try to submit a pull request for an issue within 2 days of showing interest, even if you are not through fixing the issue.
* A pull request should be linked to the issue it aims to fix. [_**Watch tutorial.**_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqJWDTZdQG4\&list=PLMDhbo3xlD1ESa1\_9WN4yG7bGDDksEQx7\&index=4\&t=301s)
* Pull request title must reflect the Issue title you are working on, and it should start with "Fix: ". For example, If the issue title is "Add contribution rules section", the pull request title should be "Fix: Add contribution rules section". [_**Watch tutorial.**_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej396Vra1oQ\&list=PLMDhbo3xlD1ESa1\_9WN4yG7bGDDksEQx7\&index=14)
* Feel free to ask questions in the community channels, if you are not clear about something in the issue you are working on.
